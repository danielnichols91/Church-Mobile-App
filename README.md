# Church-Mobile-App
Building a mobile app for churches as my senior project. 

## Pathway App End-User Manual

## Installation

Pathway Church Mobile App is available for download on Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store. To install the app to your mobile device(phone or tablet), go to either the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store and search “Pathway Church”. Scroll until you find the option titled “Pathway Church App” and has this logo: 

Once downloaded, open the app and allow permissions for sending notifications so can receive important notifications and updates. 

## Home 

Press the upcoming events banner to navigate to the events page. Alternatively, use the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen to get to different screens. Each social media icon will open the corresponding link to the church’s account if pressed to stay connected on multiple levels. 
The church’s master calendar is connected, so users can click on different events to bring up details. The banners below the calendar link to different pages on the church’s website, including mission and beliefs, staff info, and their home page. 

## Events

The Events page has two sections; the Special Events are church events that are not offered on a regular schedule. Examples of these types of events include a Christmas Eve service, a Women's Conference Guest Speaker, or a Summer Bible Camp. If a user selects the “Reoccurring Events” tab at the top right of the screen, it will show events that occur on a regular schedule. Examples of this type of event include Sunday Morning Service, Men’s Weekly Bible Study, or New Members Class every month. 
Special Events can be selected to view more details. On this more details page, there may be a registration required to attend the event. If registration is required, there will be a form at the bottom of the page. Fill out the requested information and press submit to register for the event.  

## Watch

This page contains the two most recent videos uploaded to the Pathway YouTube channel, which will normally be the Traditional 9 am service and the Modern 11 am Service. If not the case, the link at the bottom of the screen will bring users to the Church’s full Youtube channel with their entire catalog of past sermons. Embedded YouTube videos can played in the app and can be maximized to full screen for a better viewing experience. 

## Donate

The Donate tab will be an easy way to navigate to Pathway’s website for online donations.
